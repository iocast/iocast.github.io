Title: node-webkit desktop application and 3rd party libraries
Author: iocast
Date: 2014-04-30
Summary: In this post I want to describe how you create a platform independent application using node-webkit including 3rd party libraries such as node-sqlite3. It shows you, how you setup a development environment, rebuild your dependencies and build your platform specific versions of your application on the basis of the [time edition project][]

**To the readers**: I anticipate, that you know what nodejs, node-webkit is and their concept.

## Preparation

Sadly, before we can start to code, we need to setup our environment. First download the desired version of the node-webkit from [rogerwangs' GitHub repository][node-webkit] and extract the archive file to the place you want to have it. Then do the same for the [nodejs][]. If you **do not** want to install nodejs, consider downloading the **binaries** and NOT the installer.

Now we are almost ready to code. Lets have a short look at the folder structure.

```
../
 |- project/
      |- nodejs/
	  |    |- bin/
	  |    |- ...
      |- node-webkit/
	       |- node-webkit.app
	       |- ...
```

Now we need to create the necessary subdirectories for our project. So create the following folders

```bash
mkdir -p project/node-webkit/node_modules project/node-webkit/app
```


## First steps




### Configuration


### Creating your own modules




### Using a template engine

[swig][]

```bash
cd project/node-webkit
project/nodejs/bin/npm install swig --save
```


## 3rd party libraries

Third party libraries needs normally a rebuild for your target. [nw-gyp][] is needed to do a rebuild of a prebuilt library to your installed target system. Hence we need to install [nw-gyp][] globally.

```bash
project/nodejs/bin/npm install -g nw-gyp
```

Now we are ready to install the desired 3rd party libraries. First you need to install the library

```bash
cd project/node-webkit
project/nodejs/bin/npm install sqlite3@2.2.0 --save
```

and then rebuild the library for your target system

```bash
cd project/node-webkit/node_modules/sqlite3
project/nodejs/bin/node project/nodejs/lib/node_modules/nw-gyp/bin/nw-gyp.js rebuild --target=0.8.5
```

where target is the version number of the node-webkit you have downloaded.


```bash
project/nodejs/bin/npm cache clean
```

```bash
project/nodejs/bin/npm install -g bower
project/nodejs/bin/node project/nodejs/lib/node_modules/bower/bin/bower init
bower install --save Polymer/polymer
```
