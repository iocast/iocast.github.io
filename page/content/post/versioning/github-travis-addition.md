First of all check if you have already a **personal access token**.

![GitHub personal access tokens](github_personal_access_tokens.png "GitHub personal access tokens")

If not, you can follow these [instructions]({% post_url 2013-10-08-github-jekyll-travis %})


On Travis we need to grant access to the GitHub repository. Login to Travis and in your account settings under repositories you can enable a project.

The next thing is to generate a new secure string for your `.travis.yml` file. First we need to get the GitHub personal access token, which you generated beforehand. Run the following command to get a list of all your access tokens.

```bash
curl -X GET -u <your_github_username> https://api.github.com/authorizations
```

You should get a JSON response which looks like this

```json
...
{
	"id": 1234567,
	"url": "https://api.github.com/authorizations/1234567",
	"app": {
		"name": "travis: token for pushing from travis (API)",
		"url": "http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth_authorizations/",
		"client_id": "00000000000000000000"
		},
	"token": "1abc234d56efghi789",
	"note": "travis: token for pushing from travis",
	"note_url": null,
	"created_at": "2014-01-01T12:00:00Z",
	"updated_at": "2014-01-01T12:00:00Z",
	"scopes": [
		"public_repo"
	]
},
...
```


So we are ready to generate the secure string for Travis. Be sure that you have installed `travis` rubygem using the following command `gem install travis`. Open a terminal and go to the folder where `.travis.yml` lays and add the secure string to it

```bash
cd /path/to/the/.travsi.yml/file
travis encrypt -r <user>/<repository> GH_TOKEN=<token> --add env.global
```

That's all the magic. You are done and can push your changes to the GitHub repository which automatically deploys it on Travis CI.
