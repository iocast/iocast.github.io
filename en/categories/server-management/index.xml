You can find the official documentation here. Under Ubuntu you can simple install this package using apt-get.
apt-get install likewise-open Once you have installed it, you can join a Active Directory (AD) as follow.
domainjoin-cli join --ou Hosting/&amp;lt;path&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;to&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;your&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;organization-unit&amp;gt; &amp;lt;server&amp;gt; &amp;lt;login-user&amp;gt; where you need to define the path to your organization unit, which is displayed in the AD as a folder.</description></item><item><title>Mac OS X file server migration</title><link>https://iocast.github.io/en/post/server-management/osx-file-server-migration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iocast.github.io/en/post/server-management/osx-file-server-migration/</guid><description>Managing a OS X server is sometimes a pain, when it comes to manage ACL permissions on the file system using OS X Server share point application.
