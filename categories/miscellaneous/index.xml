      <description>Github offers at the time of writing three different types of pages: for users, organizations and projects. For the users and organizations the master branch is going to be used to deploy as static web page. For projects, means in a repository which is not called username.github.io, a subpath of the user pages would be created username.github.io/projectname.
Hence this post is going to discuss the a simple workflow using Github&amp;rsquo;s user pages, jekyll as blog and pseudo dynamic page, travis as our continuous integration solution for deployment purposes.</description>

      <description>Source code: shell script
Tunneling over a intermediar is often used to connect to a server which is e.g. in a DMZ. In the following case we have a server that is the company network and does only allow connections on port 22 from the DMZ. Means the server cannot be connection over the internet. In addition, we have a server in the DMZ which allows connection on port 22 from outside (internet) and can connect to the company network over port 22.</description>
