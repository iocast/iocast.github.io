      <description>Installation I flashed the SD card using ETCHER with the latest Armbian without desktop.
Once ETCHER is done burning the image on the SD card, insert the card into the Pine64 and attach an ethernet cable. Then login to the system as root
$ ssh root@192.168.0.10 The default password is 1234. Only after the first login you are asked to change root&amp;rsquo;s password and to create a default user with sudo privilege.</description>

      <description>For my file server I have the following requirements:
 it should consume as less as possible electricity it should be very silent, means no active cooling the operation system should use OpenSSH  Thus, for the hardware I have decided to use a Cubox from SolidRun because it has a very good value for money. Notice that I use the first revision of the Cubox and not the Cubox-i serie.</description>
