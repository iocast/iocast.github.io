      <description>Installation I flashed the SD card using ETCHER with the latest Armbian without desktop.
Once ETCHER is done burning the image on the SD card, insert the card into the Pine64 and attach an ethernet cable. Then login to the system as root
$ ssh root@192.168.0.10 The default password is 1234. Only after the first login you are asked to change root&amp;rsquo;s password and to create a default user with sudo privilege.</description>

      <description>For my file server I have the following requirements:
 it should consume as less as possible electricity it should be very silent, means no active cooling the operation system should use OpenSSH  Thus, for the hardware I have decided to use a Cubox from SolidRun because it has a very good value for money. Notice that I use the first revision of the Cubox and not the Cubox-i serie.</description>

      <description>Take some seconds and thing about how you represent a date or number. Do you convert the object to a string and slices it at the needed position? Or do you extend the Date class and adds some new output representation functionality.
Since the ECMA-402 Standard, published on December 2012, you have some really great new functions which respects the locale settings of your environment.
Okey, lets take a step back.</description>

      <description>First of all check if you have already a personal access token.
If not, you can follow these instructions
On Travis we need to grant access to the GitHub repository. Login to Travis and in your account settings under repositories you can enable a project.
The next thing is to generate a new secure string for your .travis.yml file. First we need to get the GitHub personal access token, which you generated beforehand.</description>

      <title>Joining a Active Directory on Linux - the easiest way!</title>
      <link>http://iocast.github.io/post/server-management/linux-join-ad/</link>

      <description>The easiest way, at least for me, is to use the likewise-open package. You can find the official documentation here. Under Ubuntu you can simple install this package using apt-get.
apt-get install likewise-open Once you have installed it, you can join a Active Directory (AD) as follow.
domainjoin-cli join --ou Hosting/&amp;lt;path&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;to&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;your&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;organization-unit&amp;gt; &amp;lt;server&amp;gt; &amp;lt;login-user&amp;gt; where you need to define the path to your organization unit, which is displayed in the AD as a folder.</description>

      <description>Removing preinstalled packages First we need to check which PostgreSQL, PostGIS and GDAL versions are installed. To do so check your Debian package management system (dpkg).
dpkg -l | grep &amp;#39;postgres\|gdal&amp;#39; You should get a list like the following one:
ii libgdal-dev 1.10.0-1~precise1 Geospatial Data Abstraction Library - Development files ii libgdal1-dev 1.10.0-1~precise1 Geospatial Data Abstraction Library - Development files ii libgdal1h 1.10.0-1~precise1 Geospatial Data Abstraction Library ii postgresql-9.1 9.</description>

      <description>When you have installed CentOS 6 using the minimal image we need first to do some preparation. Fist login into your system and enable your eth0 at startup.
vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 and set ONBOOT to yes.
Getting Python 2.7.x The following explanations are based on a blog of Asim Teeshan and a post on Fire3Net.
First we need some development tools. Install the following once
yum install gcc make zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel Now download the latest 2.</description>

      <description>QGIS server provides a web map server (WMS) by simply copying a QGIS project int the server directory. If you want to depend on newer postgresql-libs you need first to install the desired version of PostgreSQL and PostGIS as described bellow.
PostgreSQL and PostGIS The following instructions are adapted from YUM installation - PostgreSQL wiki and UsersWikiuPostGIS20CentOS6pgdg - PostGIS.
Configuration Configure yum repository
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo and add the following excludes to base and updates sections:</description>

      <title>Mac OS X file server migration</title>

      <description>Managing a OS X server is sometimes a pain, when it comes to manage ACL permissions on the file system using OS X Server share point application. For example if you want to migrate from one file server to another you need to define all shares and ACLs again or if you want to propagate permissions on a share with explicit ACLs on a sub-directory you are going to overwrite these explicit ACLs.</description>

      <title>Creating your own blog using github pages, jekyll and travis</title>
      <link>http://iocast.github.io/post/miscellaneous/github-jekyll-travis/</link>

      <description>Github offers at the time of writing three different types of pages: for users, organizations and projects. For the users and organizations the master branch is going to be used to deploy as static web page. For projects, means in a repository which is not called username.github.io, a subpath of the user pages would be created username.github.io/projectname.
Hence this post is going to discuss the a simple workflow using Github&amp;rsquo;s user pages, jekyll as blog and pseudo dynamic page, travis as our continuous integration solution for deployment purposes.</description>

      <title>Tunneling over an intermediate to overcome demilitarized zone</title>
      <link>http://iocast.github.io/post/miscellaneous/tunneling-over-an-intermediate/</link>

      <guid>http://iocast.github.io/post/miscellaneous/tunneling-over-an-intermediate/</guid>
      <description>Source code: shell script
Tunneling over a intermediar is often used to connect to a server which is e.g. in a DMZ. In the following case we have a server that is the company network and does only allow connections on port 22 from the DMZ. Means the server cannot be connection over the internet. In addition, we have a server in the DMZ which allows connection on port 22 from outside (internet) and can connect to the company network over port 22.</description>
