Tunneling over a intermediar is often used to connect to a server which is e.g. in a DMZ. In the following case we have a server that is the company network and does only allow connections on port 22 from the DMZ. Means the server cannot be connection over the internet. In addition, we have a server in the DMZ which allows connection on port 22 from outside (internet) and can connect to the company network over port 22.</description>
