it should consume as less as possible electricity it should be very silent, means no active cooling the operation system should use OpenSSH Thus, for the hardware I have decided to use a Cubox from SolidRun because it has a very good value for money. Notice that I use the first revision of the Cubox and not the Cubox-i serie.</description></item></channel></rss>
