      <description>Installation I flashed the SD card using ETCHER with the latest Armbian without desktop.
Once ETCHER is done burning the image on the SD card, insert the card into the Pine64 and attach an ethernet cable. Then login to the system as root
$ ssh root@192.168.0.10 The default password is 1234. Only after the first login you are asked to change root&amp;rsquo;s password and to create a default user with sudo privilege.</description>

      <description>Source code: shell script
Tunneling over a intermediar is often used to connect to a server which is e.g. in a DMZ. In the following case we have a server that is the company network and does only allow connections on port 22 from the DMZ. Means the server cannot be connection over the internet. In addition, we have a server in the DMZ which allows connection on port 22 from outside (internet) and can connect to the company network over port 22.</description>
